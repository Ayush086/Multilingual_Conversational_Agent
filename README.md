Voice-Based Conversational AI with Sarvam AI
This project implements a voice-based conversational AI system using Sarvam AI's APIs for speech-to-text (ASR), chat completion (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS). The system records user audio, transcribes it, generates a response using a language model, converts the response to audio, and plays it back. It supports multilingual interactions, particularly for regional Indian languages.
Features

Speech-to-Text: Transcribes spoken audio using Sarvam AI's ASR API with automatic language detection.
Conversational AI: Generates responses using Sarvam AI's chat completion API.
Text-to-Speech: Synthesizes responses into audio in the detected language using Sarvam AI's TTS API.
Multilingual Support: Handles multiple languages, leveraging Sarvam AI's capabilities for regional Indian languages.
Error Handling: Robust checks for API responses and audio processing.

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
A valid Sarvam AI API key (sign up at Sarvam AI).
A working microphone and speakers for audio input/output.
Internet connection to access Sarvam AI APIs.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Install Dependencies:Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install requests sounddevice soundfile


Set Up API Key:Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the main.py script with your actual Sarvam AI API key:
API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key"



Usage

Run the script:python main.py


Follow the prompts:
The program will record audio for 5 seconds when prompted ("üéôÔ∏è Recording... Speak now!").
Speak clearly into your microphone (e.g., "Hello, how are you?" in any supported language).
The system will transcribe your speech, generate a response, and play it back as audio.



How It Works

Audio Recording: Records 5 seconds of audio using sounddevice and saves it as input.wav.
Speech-to-Text: Sends the audio to Sarvam AI's ASR API, which returns the transcribed text and detected language.
Chat Response: Sends the transcribed text to Sarvam AI's chat API to generate a conversational response.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the response to audio using Sarvam AI's TTS API in the detected language.
Playback: Plays the synthesized audio using sounddevice.

Example

User Input: "Hello, how are you?" (spoken in English or Hindi).
Transcription: transcript = "Hello, how are you?", language = "en".
Bot Response: "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!"
Output: The response is played as audio in the same language.

Configuration

Recording Duration: Modify the duration parameter in record_audio() to change recording length (default: 5 seconds).
API Endpoints:
ASR: https://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text
Chat: https://api.sarvam.ai/v1/chat/completions
TTS: https://api.sarvam.ai/text-to-speech


TTS Parameters: Adjust speaker, pitch, pace, or loudness in synthesize_speech() for different voice styles.

Troubleshooting

API Errors: Ensure your Sarvam AI API key is valid and the API endpoints are accessible.
Audio Issues: Verify your microphone and speakers are working and properly configured.
Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries (requests, sounddevice, soundfile) are installed.
Language Detection: If language detection fails, check the audio quality or specify a language code in transcribe().
